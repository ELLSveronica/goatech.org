Let\u2019s get together! Let\u2019s talk about building software together BEFORE we spend time and money, not after!\n\n\nInvite new development\n - Let\u2019s make a place where newcomers can easily find developers and users with overlapping experiences. People evaluating open vs closed ag software/hardware should find a thriving, engaged community which can make their work easier, faster, and better.\n\n\nAligning technology and actual users\n - Finding people to try, test, break, and give feedback on new technology is hard but critically important to making technology relevant and useful. By bringing users and developers together with open lines of communication, we can increase the utility of open technology in ag across the board.\n\n\nCreating a GOAT Roadmap\n - If we collectively have a plan, then we can all contribute more effectively. Let\u2019s reduce duplication of efforts, focus on common areas we all need, and put the effort of contributors into a broader context for funders so they can see the big picture.",
