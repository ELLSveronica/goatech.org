> The term goat rodeo refers to a chaotic event where many things must go right for the situation to work, a reference to the unusual and challenging aspects of blending classical and bluegrass music. Yo-Yo Ma described a goat rodeo, saying: 'If there were forks in the road and each time there was a fork, the right decision was made, then you get to a goat rodeo.' [4]

## Why?

Information about our food system should be public or easy-to-share. Unfortunately, that is often not the case. Food is currently produced by a mix of private and public entities, and information about our food system can be opaque, hard-to-find, or proprietary and farmers may have limited control of the on-farm data they generate or ability to improve the tools they use.  

Agricultural startups are often venture-funded, with interest veering toward capitalizing on farm data. Controlling such data, not just machines or sensors, is considered the most valuable game in town (at least in the short term). Closed data ecosystems hinder our ability to produce food equitably and sustainably and support farm level decision support.

Fortunately, there is also significant interest in creating open source hardware and software to increase transparency in the food chain, allow for data sharing among groups, and engage the public and make the benefits of shared data available to all. Though the number of projects is growing, they tend to be small, isolated within universities or small companies, and disconnected from one another. The result is duplication of efforts, hard to find projects, and disconnected parts producing incompatible data.  The lack of coordination means that as technology rapidly changes, closed-source companies are locking up the machinery, sensors, data, and varieties of the future.  

**The gathering will bring together the nascent open ag tech community to meet,
learn, share, and establish a common vision for creating open technologies for
our food system.**

## When?

* **Applications close** - March 20, 2018
* **Full program available** - March 31, 2018
* **Conference** - Mon - Weds, May 7 - May 9th, 2018

## Where?

The 2018 conference will be held at the beautiful
[Omega Institute](https://www.eomega.org/rhinebeck), an hour and a half train
ride north of New York City. Arrive via NYC airports and take the train or rent
a car, or it is within driving distance of most of North East.

## Who should apply?

We are looking for anyone actively involved in developing and using open
technologies in agriculture. Specifically, we are looking for developers
(programmers, engineers, designers, etc.) and active users (practitioners,
farmers, researchers, etc.) of technology. Technology is broadly defined, and
includes both traditional hardware and software, but also mechanical tools
(tractors, implements, etc.) and any domains relating to the creation of that
hardware (intellectual property + open licenses, data management, model
development, etc.)

While we are accepting applications from outside North America, we cannot
provide extensive support for complex visa applications. Be aware that you are
responsible for paperwork related to getting to the US if accepted. We hope to
make the conference more international in the future as we have more organizers
and more funding.

## What is the cost?

The conference itself is free if your application is accepted. We have funding
for travel and lodging for those who cannot afford it. Specify your funding
needs on the
[application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpH0dwCXF-Db13v6xf8hGtPrMjlS5aLl6y3KJ3243zsHt4cA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Can I get involved before the conference?

Yes! Go to the forum at [forum.goatech.org](http://forum.goatech.org) and post
your questions. You can also find discussions around GOAT and related groups in
the open ag space, so definitely check it out.

If you have ideas or suggestions on programming (speakers, activities,
nearby locations to visit, etc.) that you think are a great fit, please post
about it! We are still actively setting the program and activities.
