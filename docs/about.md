# About GOAT

> The technologies that produce our food and the data about our food system should be public.

_Together, we can collectively address the problems which prevent the creation of advanced, high quality open technology and its adoption._

## Goals

**Coordinate existing development** - there are many organizations working on open ag software and hardware today with overlapping interests. Let’s get together! Let’s talk about building software together BEFORE we spend time and money, not after!

**Invite new development** - Let’s make a place where newcomers can easily find developers and users with overlapping experiences. People evaluating open vs closed ag software/hardware should find a thriving, engaged community which can make their work easier, faster, and better.

**Aligning technology and actual users** - Finding people to try, test, break, and give feedback on new technology is hard but critically important to making technology relevant and useful. By bringing users and developers together with open lines of communication, we can increase the utility of open technology in ag across the board.

**Creating a GOAT Roadmap** - If we collectively have a plan, then we can all contribute more effectively. Let’s reduce duplication of efforts, focus on common areas we all need, and put the effort of contributors into a broader context for funders so they can see the big picture.
